We examine how demographic, economic, health, and gender-based factors intersect to shape outcomes for young people between the ages of 10 and 19.\nThrough a series of powerful data visualizations, we reveal key patterns, spotlight the world’s most vulnerable populations, and offer policy recommendations aligned with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).\nThe aim is clear: to turn data into action that can save lives."
